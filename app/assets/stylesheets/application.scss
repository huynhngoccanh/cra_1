 /*
  * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
  * listed below.
  *
  * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
  * or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path./  *
  * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
  * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any styles
  * defined in the other CSS/SCSS files in this directory. It is generally better to create a new
  * file per style scope.
